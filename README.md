# Create a Simple Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Set up a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of building and deploying a Node.js application.

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Node.js

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
- A **Jenkinsfile** to build and deploy the app.

## ðŸ’¡ Steps Followed
1. Installed Jenkins (locally or cloud instance).  
2. Created a **Jenkinsfile** in the repository with the following stages:
   - **Build** â†’ Install dependencies and build the Node.js app.  
   - **Test** â†’ Run automated tests (if available).  
   - **Deploy** â†’ Build a Docker image and run the container.  
3. Configured Jenkins to trigger the pipeline on each **code commit**.  
4. Tested the pipeline by pushing changes and verifying the Jenkins dashboard.  

## âœ… Outcome
Successfully automated the build and deployment process for the `nodejs-demo-app2`.  
Each code change now triggers the Jenkins pipeline automatically.
